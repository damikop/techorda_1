            <h1>Plot</h1>
            <p>The series takes place in two timelines: in the days of Goryeo and in the 21st century.
                Tokkebi has been living for more than nine centuries. Once he was a famous commander named Kim Shin, but the king began to fear his influence and power, and because of the intrigues of the adviser, he suspected of wanting to take power into his own hands. Kim Shin and his entire squad were shot, and Kim Shin's spirit was cursed, and he became a tokkebi, an immortal demon. He has a sword stuck in his chest forever, which only a girl with a special gift can pull out (and thereby kill the tokkebi).
                Ji Eunthak is a schoolgirl, an orphan, she works in a restaurant and lives in the house of an aunt who hates her. Eunthak sees ghosts and reapers of death, the task of one of which is to find her and escort her to another place: Eunthak should have died a long time ago, she is a "lost soul", and she has no place among living people. Having met a tokkebi, she begins to fall in love with him, but she is unaware of her role in his fate.
                The Reaper of Death is a supernatural being, a psychopomp. A workaholic, his life has been going on for three hundred years, and he does not remember the previous one. The sight of Sunny, the owner of a small restaurant, causes an unusual storm of emotions in him and makes him assume that they knew each other in a past life. 
                To fulfill their destiny, they need not only to deal with the problems of the present, but also to understand how it is connected with their common past.</p>
